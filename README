1. Introduction
---------------

The International  Astronomical Union's SOFA  Collection consists
of two libraries  of routines, one coded in Fortran  77 the other
in  ANSI C.   There  is  a suite  of  vector/matrix routines  and
various utilities  that underpin the astronomy  algorithms, which
include routines for the following:

* Calendars

* Time Scales

* Earth rotation and sidereal time

* Ephemerides (medium precision)

* Geocentric/geodetic transformations

* Precession, nutation, polar motion

* Star space motion

* Star catalogue conversion

  This  package makes  use of  the  GNU Autotools  to allow  easy
distribution and installation of SOFA.

  ATSOFA is  neither distributed,  supported nor endorsed  by the
International Astronomical Union.  Any use of this pacakge should
comply with SOFA's license and terms of use.  Especially, but not
exclusively,  any published  work  or  commercial products  which
includes results achieved by  using ATSOFA shall acknowledge that
the SOFA software was used in obtaining those results.

  *NOTE* The  last time  the maintainer  bothered to  update this
paragraph   he  had   included   the   SOFA  libraries   version:
"SOFA-Issue: 2012-03-01".

  *NOTE* The maintainer supports  only the GNU infrastructure and
tests only on a GNU+Linux system.


2. License
----------

See the COPYING file included in the distribution.


3. Install
----------

If we have  a proper release tarball, we unpack  the archive then
do:

    $ cd atsofa
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

then do it:

    $ ../configure [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  To build  the code  from a repository  checkout, we  must first
install the GNU Autotools.  The  we run the following script from
the top source directory of ATSOFA:

    $ sh autogen.sh

we  should now  see  the executable  "configure"  script and  the
"Makefile.in" file.   From now on  everything is the same  as for
building from a proper release tarball.

  The  Makefile  supports  the DESTDIR  environment  variable  to
install files in a temporary  location, example: to see what will
happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/atsofa

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/atsofa


4. Usage
--------

Read the original documentation of SOFA.


5. How to
---------

Here is an overview of how  to repackage SOFA.  The original SOFA
libraries come in 2 archives, one  for the C language version and
one for the Fortran language.

* Both archives  have a "doc" subdirectory  holding documentation
  file.  Take one  of these directories and copy  the contents in
  the "doc" subdirectory of ATSOFA.

* C source  files (both  .c and  .h) go  unchanged under  the "c"
  subdirectory  of ATSOFA,  with  the  exception of  "t_sofa_c.c"
  which is the test file and goes under "test-c".

* Fortran source files go  unchanged under the "f77" subdirectory
  of ATSOFA,  with the exception  of "t_sofa_f.for" which  is the
  test file and goes under "test-f77".

* C source files must be explicitly listed in "c/Makefile.am", as
  is already shown.

* Fortran   source   files   must   be   explicitly   listed   in
  "f77/Makefile.am", as is already shown.

  Packaging with  the GNU Autotools  is by Marco Maggi.   If this
package exists it's because of  the great GNU software tools that
he uses all the time.
